* Developers
We are trying to ensure that we develop to the current agile best
practice including:
- Test driven development
- Inline documentation
- Continuous build
** Coding standards
We try to confirm to [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/][PEP 8]] for code standards and [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/][PEP 257]] for
Docstring conventions.
** Virtual environments.
We recommend that developers set up a virtualenv environment to ensure
that we don't clash with system-wide Python packages.
